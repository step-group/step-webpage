# Positions

<div style="text-align: justify"> If you are interested in joining our group, please first take a look at our [research projects](https://step-group.github.io/step-webpage/research) and publications to learn about our laboratory research interests. We are pleased to welcome candidates interested in separation processes with diverse backgrounds and interests, from experimental, thermodynamic modeling, molecular dynamics to process simulation.

Undergraduate students seeking research opportunities through the IPRE program are encouraged to directly reach out to our graduate students in the group whose interests are relevant (e.g., first authors of recent publications they find interesting). For UC undergraduate students, we advertise research opportunities in the [Gesti√≥n IPRE](https://gestionipre.investigacion.ing.uc.cl/) system. We are always open to receiving international undergraduate students for research internships; please contact the Principal Investigators directly.

Graduate students, both master's and doctoral, are welcome to join the group, subject to the availability of funding for our projects. Applications to our graduate programs can be made directly through the [Graduate Department](https://postgrado.ing.uc.cl/) website of the UC School of Engineering. Before applying, please contact the principal investigators to arrange an interview and find a research topic of mutual interest. It is desirable that the application be accompanied by a national or international funding source, such as [ANID](https://anid.cl/capital-humano-2/doctorado-nacional/); otherwise, there are certain alternatives please reach us. Admissions are normally in May and October. Although we are an international group, Spanish proficiency is desirable for graduate studies, as lessons are mainly in Spanish. 

Postdoctoral opportuinites that we are actively recruiting will be advertised on this page. Interested postdocs should inquire directly at the Principal Investigators with a CV and a brief statement of your research interests and background. If we don't have any postings, we will keep your materials and may reach out to sponsor you in the [Fondecyt Postdoctoral](https://anid.cl/proyectos-de-investigacion/fondecyt-postdoctorado/) call.
