### Welcome to the STEP Laboratory Website!

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We are part of the School of Chemical Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Led by Dr.-Ing. Nicolás F. Gajardo-Parra and Dr. Roberto I. Canales, we study thermodynamics, separation processes and phase equilibria. Our recent work centres on deep-eutectic and ionic liquids, combining experiments with PC-SAFT modelling to design safer, greener extraction and reaction technologies.
