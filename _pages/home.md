<p style="text-align: justify;">

Based in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Bioprocesses at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, our laboratory led by Dr. Roberto Canales and Dr. Nicolás Gajardo-Parra integrates expertise in thermodynamics, molecular modeling, process systems engineering, and experimental techniques to advance the development of innovative separation processes. We focus on the rational design of separation systems by combining computational tools—such as activity coefficient models, molecular simulations, and process simulators—with experimental validation. Our research spans diverse sectors, including the chemical industry, food processing, and biotechnology, where we address complex challenges related to component purification, solvent selection, and sustainable process design. A significant portion of our work is computational, utilizing predictive thermodynamic frameworks, molecular-level insights, and increasingly, data-driven approaches to model separation phenomena. However, we maintain a strong connection to experimental work, both to validate our models and to explore new extraction and purification strategies using green solvents and emerging technologies. One of the defining features of our group is our ability to frame separation challenges in a way that preserves their real-world complexity while making them accessible to rigorous modeling, simulation, and optimization tools, bridging theory and practice to deliver impactful industrial and scientific solutions.
