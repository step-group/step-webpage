# Coley Research Group Website

This is the repo for the website of the Coley Research group at MIT. It is modified on top of a Jekyll template developed by the Allan Lab.

## Contributor Guide

All Coley Group members are free to make changes and additions to the website (such as adding/removing themselves to/from the "People" page) through this repo, pending approval. The existing templating combined with the following guide should hopefully make this process as painless as possible. Stylistic or template change suggestions are also welcome but may require navigating some messy templates or CSS.

Before you do anything, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your machine. Then, **(1)** fork this repo and **(2)** clone the forked repo to your local machine with the command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/{your_username}/coley.mit.edu.git
```

### Local deployment

If you are making non-trivial changes (i.e. beyond just adding yourself to the "People" page), it is highly encouraged to locally deploy the website on your machine to preview the website before making a pull request. First, install Jekyll if you have not done so, following [the official guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) corresponding to your OS. 

In the folder corresponding to your cloned repo, simply run the following to serve the website at `http://localhost:4000`.
```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

### Making changes and pull requests

First, working in your forked repo, create and checkout a new branch (give it a descriptive name) with the command
```bash
$ git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
```
After you make your changes, commit and push your changes to the branch:
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
$ git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME
```
Finally, perform a pull request so that your changes can be reviewed and merged into the main repo. This can be done easily through the Github UI on the browser from your fork repo page.

### Adding you or someone else to the "People" page

Adding yourself to the People page is very simple!
1. Upload an image of yourself to `images/teampic/` with the format `{firstname}_{lastname}.[png|jpg|jpeg]`. **Please crop your image to a square**.
2. Navigate to the `_data/` folder and locate the `.yml` file that matches your position in the group (for instance, if you are a grad student, open `grad_students.yml`). 
3. Add all relevant information in the `.yml` file. 
    - Fill out `name` and `email` at minimum, with optional URLs provided in `twitter`, `linkedin`, and/or `website` fields.
    - Add a short biography for the `description` field.

That's it! Go ahead and make a pull request when you are satisfied.

### Adding publications

Some instructions for adding publications and a template are at the top of the (`_data/publications.yml`) file for your convenience. The main format for a citation is as follows:
- Author list. Linked Title. *Journal*. Volume(Issue), Pages. (Year) DOI/preprint: DOI/preprint_ID.

The minimum required fields are: `title`, `authors`, `journal`, `year`, `url`, `themes`.
- For journal papers, be sure to at least include `doi`
- For preprints, be sure to at least include `preprint`, `preprint_url`
- For conference papers, be sure to at least include `preprint_url`

If the `preprint_url` field is filled out, then the preprint button will appear under the citation.

Further, research themes should be added for each paper and they will appear as tags below the citation. The available themes and their associated colors are found in (`_data/research_themes.yml`). Currently these themes are: 
- molecular representation
- design and optimization
- predictive chemistry
- automation
- metabolomics
- data

Note: There are slight nuances with respect to the `doi` and `preprint` fields since the former supercedes the latter.
- For preprints
    - Do NOT include the `doi` field
    - DO include the `preprint` and related fields.
- For conference papers
    - Do NOT include `doi` OR `preprint` fields.
    - DO include `url`, `preprint_url`, `preprint_site`, `preprint_year`.

### Other changes

The following have been set up to be similarly easy to add new content to. Hopefully it should be simple to extrapolate the editing of `.yml` files to the following, but ask Kevin or Kento if you need help.
- News (`_data/news.yml`)
- Group photos (`_data/photos.yml`, images go in `images/grouppic/`)
- Open source software (`_data/software.yml`, logos go in `images/logopic`)
- Research relevant to Connor's directions on the "Research" page (`_data/research.yml`)
- WIP: The carousel highlighting recent work still needs to be refactored to be easily editable with `.yml` files. For now, they are manually declared in `_includes/carousel.html` with pictures in `image/carouselpic`)
