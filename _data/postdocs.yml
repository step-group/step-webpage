  description: Esteban Cea-Klapp holds a PhD in Chemical Engineering from UDEC, with expertise in thermodynamic modeling, molecular simulations, and the design of sustainable solvent systems. His research focuses on deep eutectic solvents (DESs) for green chemical processes, integrating multiscale modeling and computational tools to predict thermophysical and interfacial properties. Esteban’s work bridges molecular insights with process-level applications, contributing to the development of efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for CO₂ capture and biomass valorization.
